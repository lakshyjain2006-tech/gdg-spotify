# spotify_clone_
This is a Spotify clone that I got as a task from the GDC club.
This project is a functional, single-page clone of the Spotify Web Player interface, built using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a submission for the GDG Web Development Task, demonstrating proficiency in front-end structure, styling, and dynamic manipulation of the Audio API.

KEY FEATURES :

1) Core Functionality (The Clone) : 
Responsive Layout: The design adapts seamlessly to both desktop and mobile viewports.

Music Player Controls: Fully functional Play/Pause, Next/Previous song navigation.

Dynamic Seekbar: Users can drag the circular handle or click anywhere on the seekbar to jump to a specific part of the song.

Time & Volume Control: Displays current song time and allows volume adjustment via a range input.

Visual Song Highlight: The currently playing song is visibly highlighted in the "Your Library" list.

2) Unique Implementations : 
Mood-Based Filtering : Implemented custom JavaScript filtering logic to dynamically re-render the entire songList based on mood categories (Happy, Chill, Workout), showing effective data manipulation and DOM updating.

Mini-Progress Bar : A subtle mini-progress bar appears next to the currently playing song in the library list. This uses the audio.timeupdate event listener combined with CSS Variables (--progress-width) for smooth, real-time visual feedback, enhancing the UX.

Duration bar : u can also seprate song on the basis of time duration

Now playing bar : u can see the  song details and it will resume from where u left the song

Authentic UI/UX: A high-fidelity reproduction of the modern Spotify Web Player interface, including the dark theme, sidebar, and main content area.

Categorized Content Display: Organized sections for:

    Spotify Playlists (e.g., Happy Hits, Chill Beats)

    Famous Artists (e.g., Arijit Singh, Taylor Swift)

    Popular Albums and Singles
